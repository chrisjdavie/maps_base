This will take in London postcodes, add some numbers to each postcode and do a colour plot of that.

This is an example of my maps plotting routine.  The data prep stuff is in 
'getting_london_postcodes/london_postcode_shapes/generate_shapefile.py', there's a readme.txt in that directory that 
explains how to get the data that it needs to point to.

Then 'maps_base/map_fn.py' can be run as an example of how this all works.
